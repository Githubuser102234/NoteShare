        <h2>Content Guidelines: Understanding "Notes"</h2>
        <p>Our platform allows for a unique feature: personal "notes." We understand that these notes can sometimes be a space for unfiltered expression. Here's how we handle certain types of language within them:</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important Note on Language in Personal Notes:</strong></p>
            <p>We permit the use of <span class="highlight">cussing, strong language, and even slurs within your personal notes, PROVIDED THAT IT IS NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP.</span> This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using such language for personal expression, comedic effect, or to convey intense emotion within your own thoughts is generally acceptable.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">However, any language, including cussing or slurs, that is used to harass, threaten, abuse, defame, or directly target another user or group will result in immediate action.</span> This is a zero-tolerance policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <li><span class="highlight">Hate Speech:</span> Content that promotes discrimination, hatred, or violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Threats of Violence:</span> Any credible threats of harm or violence towards others, including self-harm.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Child Exploitation:</span> Any content related to child sexual abuse or exploitation is strictly prohibited and will be reported to the appropriate authorities.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Graphic Content:</span> Excessive or gratuitous violence, gore, or sexually explicit material not relevant to artistic or educational purposes.</li>
