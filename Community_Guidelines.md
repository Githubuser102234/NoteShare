# 📜 Community Guidelines

Welcome to our text-sharing platform! To keep this space open, expressive, and respectful, please follow these simple guidelines:

## ✅ What’s Allowed
- ✅ You may use strong language (including cussing or slurs) **as long as it is not directed at any individual or group**.
- ✅ Sharing personal opinions, rants, jokes, and raw thoughts is okay—this platform supports free expression.
- ✅ Creative, dark, or offensive humor is permitted within reason, **as long as it is not intended to attack or threaten others**.

## 🚫 What’s NOT Allowed
- ❌ **Direct harassment or bullying** of any kind (e.g. "You're a [slur]" or "[User] should die") is strictly prohibited.
- ❌ **Targeted slurs or hate speech** directed at a person or group based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, or disability.
- ❌ **Threats of violence**, doxxing, or promoting harmful actions.

## ⚖️ Moderation Policy
- 🚨 Notes found to contain **targeted hate**, **harassment**, or **credible threats** may be removed without warning.
- 🔇 Users who repeatedly violate these guidelines may be banned or restricted from posting.

**TL;DR**: You can say whatever you want *as long as you're not being a jerk to someone else.* Free speech is cool—targeted hate isn't.
